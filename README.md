# note-taker
This application will store notes from the user in the back end and allow them to view and delete them at a later time.

When the user opens the Note Taker, they are presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page.<br>
When they click on the "get started" button, then they are presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column,<br> plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column<br>
When the user enters a new note title and the note’s text, then a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page<br>
When the save icon is clicked, the new note entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes<br>
When an existing note is clicked on the left hand column, that note appears in the right-hand column<br>
When the + icon is clickedI click in the navigation at the top of the page<br>
then the user is presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column

IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES:
When the "get started" button is clicked from the landing page, the user is redirected to : https://note-taker-gk.herokuapp.com/notes.html<br>
the user must change the URL to https://note-taker-gk.herokuapp.com/notes which will take them to the functioning notes.html page.
